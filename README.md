# TurboModule vs JSBridge and Flutter

This repository will show you how to integrate with the TurboModule and Fabric, compare the performance of JSBridge and Turbo Module, and compare the performance of Flutter.

According to the test results, the communication efficiency of TurboModule and Native is about 20 times that of JSBridge, while the implementation of Flutter is not stable, with an average of about 500 milliseconds and a maximum of more than 900 mm. So TurboModule performance is about 3 to 4 times better than flutter performance,it's amazing!!!
